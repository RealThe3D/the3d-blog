# The3D Blog

This is my personal blog, written in TypeScript using Next.js!

You'll find me rambling about nonsense here.

# Can I use this for myself?

Sure! Remember to update `app/page.tsx`, `components/Navbar.tsx`, `app/favicon.ico`, `app/layout.tsx`, `content/posts/`, and `public/` as neccessary.<br />
You're free to change up the other files and submit a PR for changes I should implement.

# File Structure

- `app/` - The root of the project. Most of the content is here.
- `components/` - React Components used throughout the project.
- `content/posts` - Stores all the MDX (pages) for the blog.
- `public/` - Images.
