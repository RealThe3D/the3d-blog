# Backstory

The Boston Celtics, a basketball team based in the great city of Boston in the National Basketball Association.
Prior to the 2024 NBA Finals, this amazing team has won a total of 17 Championships in the NBA, tied at the time with the most championships won by any NBA team with the Los Angeles Lakers (Associated Press). They dominated the 1960s, but won their latest championship in 2008, until now.
The Boston Celtics secured their 18th NBA championship on June 17, 2024 at their home arena, defeating the Dallas Mavericks 4-1. A question you may ask is, what led to them winning this season?

# The Two Jays

Well, it’s mainly because of the dynamic duo, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. When Brown joined the NBA and Celtics back in 2016-17, he instantly skyrocketed to be one of the best rookies in the league.
In addition, Tatum joined afterwards next season to also give the Celtics a lot more manpower. Combined with their head coach, Joe Mazzulla, it was the secret recipe to creating an overpowered team.

# Struggle, but Hope

At the end of 2021-22 finals, the Celtics lost to the Warriors during Game 6. While a defeat for the Celtics, it showed that they had the opportunity to come back to the Finals and show who’s boss. In the 2023 Playoffs, the Celtics made it to the Eastern Conference Finals but fell short to the Miami Heat in Game 7. Another blow for the Celtics, but it wasn’t over. In the 2024 Playoffs, they wouldn’t let their rival team that blocked them from entering the Finals eliminate them once more. In Game 5 of the first round, they defeated the Heat 4-1 (Associated Press). In round 2, 4-2 to the Cavaliers. Eastern Conference Finals? Swept the Pacers. Their last opponent being the Dallas Mavericks in the West. After winning the first three games, losing the fourth one, it was destined for the leprechauns to take home their next trophy.

In short, Mazzulla’s coaching and Tatum and Brown’s performances are what led to the Celtics taking home their 18th championship win.
