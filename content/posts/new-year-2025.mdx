# Happy New Year's!

Another short post to say Happy New Year's and welcome to 2025! ðŸŽ‰

Since the beginning of 2024, I have made **6** posts!

- Warframe 2023 was amazing
- Rest in Peace, Toriyama
- The Celtics Won the 2024 Finals
- What happened at CrowdStrike
- Deno 2, I love it
- Happy New Year's! (this post)

## Technical updates

In terms of technical updates, I have made a few changes to the blog:

- Rewrite from `contentlayer` to `velite`, because `contentlayer` is discontinued for the foreseeable future
- Update to React 19
- CLS Improvements

## Future posts

I hope to make more posts in 2025, and I so far have 2 planned to be released this month!

Congrats on making it to 2025, and I hope to see you continue reading this year!
