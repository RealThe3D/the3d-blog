# 2.2 (might) come out in November

Geometry Dash's 2.2 MIGHT release in November, 6 years after 2.1's release in 2017. Is disaster going to strike when 2.2 eventually comes out?

# Why 2.2 is important

It's an update that will drop a LOT of content. New triggers, camera controls, platformer mode, shaders, you name it.

It will undoubtedly be the game's largest update, but will disaster occur with the update's release?

No. It won't.

RobTop has updated the servers for 2.2. This means the servers won't be overloaded on release.
Unlike how they did when WHAT by Spu7nix was released.

The first few 2.2 levels will be hectic, but that's ok. See ya around~
