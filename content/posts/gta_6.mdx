# Finally, at last.

GTA 6, one of the most anticipated games of this (and last) decade is finally getting a trailer.
Weirdly, I was 7 years old when GTA V was released for the PS3, and now 17 when the sequel gets a trailer. Barely into elementary, now almost wrapping up High School.

# Trip to the past

I remember vividly playing GTA V as a kid (don't ask why my parents let me play an adult game as a child, ok?), and I recently did a playthrough on PC in December 2022.
The game was still fun, 9 years later.

There's a reason why the game is the 2nd best-selling game of all time.

## Open world.

GTA V is an open-world game. Meaning it is a game with a large map that you can traverse through freely with little restrictions.
Open-world games are among the most popular games of this decade, with games such as:

- Genshin Impact
- The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
- Red Dead Redemption 2 (Another Rockstar game!)
- Far Cry 6
- Cyberpunk 2077

Just to name a few. All of these are highly successful games.

## Unique gameplay.

In GTA V, you are a criminal who executes some of the (digital) world's best heists. GTA has been running this formula for over 25 years.
No other game has come close to GTA when it comes to the "be a criminal" playstyle of video games. Most games revolve around you being the hero, but in GTA, you are the villain.

## The content.

Although the story mode has an amazing amount of content, around 10-20 hours of it, GTA V has more than just that. It has a multiplayer called "GTA Online".
While it is a cesspool of Oppressors MK2 spammers and Rockstar Games milks GTA Online dry, it has over 9 years' worth of content for you to play. Whether you do the Cayo Perico Heist or The Contract, there's always something to do in GTA Online.

# Will GTA VI live up to GTA V's glory?

I'm uncertain. Time will tell. We'll just have to see when the trailer drops at 9 AM EST on December 5th.
