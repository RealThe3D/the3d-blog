Akira Toriyama, aged 68, had passed away on March 1st from acute subdural hematoma.
He was most known for his work, **Dragon Ball**, and others such as Chrono Trigger.

**Dragon Ball** is one of, if not the most popular anime ever made.
It had a great impact on the anime/manga industry. Many animes and mangas made today would be vastly different without Toriyama's work.

Even in Western animation, he had a huge impact. **Dragon Ball** is one of the most-watched animes in the Western world. Dragon Ball introduced anime/manga to the Western population. Anime's widespread popularity happened because of Toriyama.
Many Western animations get some inspiration from Toriyama's work.

Rest in peace, Toriyama. We will never forget how marvelous you were, and how you affected the world.
