# Warframe

Warframe is 2013 sci-fi looter shooter by Digital Extremes. It's free to play and has 10 years of content in it.
The former (now CEO) Creative Director of Warframe is Steve Sinclair, but the game is now being led by Rebecca Ford as of 2022. However, 2023 has been of the best years in Warframe history.

## 2023's Updates + TennoCon

- Citrine's Last Wish (February 2023)
- The Duviri Paradox (April 2023)
- The Seven Crimes of Kullervo (June 2023)
- Echoes of Duviri (July 2023)
- TennoCon 2023 (Aug 2023)
- Abyss of Dagath (Oct 2023)
- Whispers in the Walls (Dec 2023)

## Citrine's Last Wish

Citrine's Last Wish was a filler update to compensate for yet another delay for The Duviri Paradox.

It brought about of the best support warframes, Citrine, and two weapons:

- **Steflos** (medicore plasma shotgun)
- **Corufell** (Scythe that can turn into a gun)

In addition was a new mode, Mirror Defense, where you collect fragments to earn Citrine's (along with the aforementioned weapons) parts!

A host of new augments became available in the update, most notably Cathode Current for Gyre, making her one of the best DPS frames in the game.

Overall, 8/10 update.

## The Duviri Paradox

The Duviri Paradox added a LOT. **Prepare for a mouthful!**

A new quest: The Duviri Paradox unlocking a new area of the game to explore.

Plains of Duviri - A new open world area!

The Duviri Landscape has a lot of activities to do, such as:

- Maw Fishing
- Paragrimm Puzzles
- Horse racing
- Melee combat
- Boss fights
- Sheep herding
- Stories to learn about!

In the landscape, you play as the Drifter, a character with only a horse, a pistol, and a melee weapon to fight your way to freedom from Dominus Thrax.

Duviri is rogue-like, where you unlock Decrees that make you signifcantly stronger as you continue.

Along side the landscape is the Undercroft, an area in which you can use your Warframes to fight Dax/Corrupted enemies.
The Undercroft is mainly a part of the Circuit, a Warframe only mode of Duviri that allows to gain Warframes or in its Steel Path version (Warframe but significantly harder), Incarnon geneses.

Incarnon geneses can turn extremely old weapons that struggle to deal damage into endgame powerhouses. Torid went from the least used weapon to one of the most used because of it.

- Rating: 9.5/10

## The Seven Crimes of Kullervo

This was a Duviri expansion update, adding more decrees, a new Warframe named Kullervo, and a couple more activities to Duviri, such as Kullervo's boss fight.

- Rating: 7/10

## Echoes of Duviri

![](../assets/echoes_of_duviri.png)
Yet another Duviri expansion update, adding more decrees, and two Undercroft-exclusive bosses, and a couple more augments to some warframes.

- Rating: 7/10

## TennoCon 2023

Lots of stuff were shown, but in terms of future Warframe content, announced was Abyss of Dagath, Whispers in the Walls, and Warframe: 1999.

## Abyss of Dagath

![](../assets/dagath.png)
This update was a **MASSIVE** Quality of Life update.

Companions got a rework, making them unable to permanently die, and Hydroid got a rework, to become a corrosive king.

Shield gating was changed, many frames got their stats increased, and a lot more.

- Rating: 8.5/10

## Whispers in the Walls

![](../assets/whispers_in_the_walls.jpg)
This update is the start of a new cinematic chapter for Warframe.
We get to learn more about the Murmur (a new faction related to the Indifference), a new area (Sanctum Anatomica), and a new syndicate (The Cavia), along with other Quality of Life Changes, such as Arcane Dissolution.
Also in this update is Operation: Gargoyle's Cry, the first clan operation in over 3 years, which allowed players to get Arcanes very quickly.

- Rating: 9/10

# Overall

2023 was amazing year for Warframe, and I hope to see more cooler stuff added with Warframe: 1999's release and more in the future.
